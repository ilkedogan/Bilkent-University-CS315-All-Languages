<h2><font color="Blue">Boolean Expressions in C, Go, Javascript, PHP, Python, and Rust<br>
</font></h2>
<p>Expressions are the fundemental means of specifying computations in a programming language.
Expressions involve operators and operand.

</p>
<p>In this homework assignment, you will compare boolean expressions provided in six
different programming languages: C, GO (Golang), Javascript, PHP, Python, and Rust. 
You will investigate how the following design issues are addressed in these programming languages:
</p><ol>
<li>Boolean operators provided
</li><li>Data types for operands of boolean operators
</li><li>Operator precedence rules
</li><li>Operator associativity rules
</li><li>Operand evaluation order
</li><li>Short-circuit evaluation
</li></ol>

<p>For each design issue and for each language, explain the choices selected by these languages. 
Support your explanation by giving examples using code segments in these languages.
You can illustrate the answers to these questions, in different parts of a single program.
The example program must be complete, so that they can be executed directly.
The files must execute without error or warning.
</p><p>You can use online compiler/interpreters for this homework.
For each language, prepare a single source code file that examplifies and tests each issue, in the order given above. 
Your example programs must be different that the code examples that may be available in the Internet.

</p><p>Organize all of your experiments and their results and put them into a report. The report should include the following:
</p><ul>
<li>For each language and for each issue, sample code segments and the results of their execution. 
You should explain what your example does, clearly.

</li><li>A section that includes your evaluation of these languages in terms of readability and writability of boolean expressions. 
Write a paragraph discussing, in your opinion, which language is the best in terms of boolean expressions. Explain why.

</li><li>A section about your learning strategy. A learning strategy is an individual's approach to complete a task. 
In this section, discuss, in detail, the material and tools you used, experiments you performed. Also talk about personal communication, if you had. 
Give the URLs of the online compiler/interpreters you used to run your programs (10 points)
</li></ul>

<p><b>Submission:</b></p>
<p> A single <b><code>zip</code></b> or <b><code>rar</code></b> file should be submitted containing the following files with given names:
</p><ol>
<li> A single file for <b> report</b>: <tt>lastname_name_report.pdf</tt>
</li><li> A folder called, <b>Codes</b>. The contents of the folder will be as follows:
<ol>
<li> A  single file for <b> C </b> code: <tt>lastname_name.c</tt>
</li><li> A  single file for <b> Go </b> code: <tt>lastname_name.go</tt>
</li><li> A  single file for <b> Javascript </b> code: <tt>lastname_name.html</tt>
</li><li> A  single file for <b> PHP </b>  code:<tt>lastname_name.php</tt>
</li><li> A  single file for <b> Python </b>  code: <tt>lastname_name.py</tt>
</li><li> A  single file for <b> Rust </b> code: <tt>lastname_name.rs</tt>
</li></ol>
</li></ol>

<p>Please upload the  <b><code>zip</code></b> or <b><code>rar</code></b> file you created to Moodle before the due date. 

</p><p><b>Important Notes:   </b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<p></p><li>Late submissions will be accepted, with 10 points (out of 100) deduction for each extra day.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li>You may use the tutorials available in the Internet as a reference, 
but do not derive your example from the contents of the tutorials. 
If you do so, your programs may be similar to others in the class,
that causes a disciplinary investigation.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li> Collaboration on the homework is not allowed.</li><p></p>
</ul>

<b>Grading Policy:</b>
<ol type="a">
<li>Discussion of design issues (50%)
</li><li>Evaluation of languages (10%)
</li><li>Learning strategy (10%)
</li><li>Code samples (30%)
</li></ol>
