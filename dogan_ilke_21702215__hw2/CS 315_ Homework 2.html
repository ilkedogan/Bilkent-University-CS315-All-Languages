<h2><font color="Blue">Iteration Based on Data Structures in C, Go, Javascript, PHP, Python, and Rust<br>
</font></h2>
<p>Iteration that are based on data structures is one of the fundamental means of applying an operation of function 
to each element of the data structure given. 
The data structure can be a string, array, array list, list, associative array, a linked list, and so on.
In such iteration statements, the control mechanism is a call to an iterator function that returns 
the next element in some chosen order, if there is one; else the loop terminates.

</p>
<p>In this homework assignment, you will investigate the statements for iteration based on data structures
provided in six different programming languages: C, GO (Golang), Javascript, PHP, Python, and Rust. 
You will investigate how the following design issues are addressed in these programming languages:
</p><ol>
<li>Iteration statements provided,
</li><li>Data structures suitable for iteration,
</li><li>The way the next item is accessed.
</li></ol>

<p>For each language, explain how the design issues listed above are answered.
Support your explanation by giving two examples using different suitable data structures.

You can illustrate the answers to these questions, in different parts of a single program.
The example program must be complete, so that they can be executed directly.
The files must execute without error or warning.

</p><p>You can use online compilers/interpreters for this homework.
For each language, prepare a single source code file that exemplifies and tests each issue, in the order given above. 
Your example programs must be different than the code examples that may be available on the Internet.

</p><p>Organize all of your experiments and their results and put them into a report. The report should include the following:
</p><ul>
<li>For each language sample code segments and the results of their execution. 
You should explain what your example does, clearly.

</li><li>A section that includes your evaluation of these languages in terms of readability and writability of iteration statements that are based on data structures. 
Write a paragraph discussing, in your opinion, which language is the best in terms of iteration statements based on data structures. Explain why.

</li><li>A section about your learning strategy. A learning strategy is an individual's approach to complete a task. 
In this section, discuss, in detail, the material and tools you used, experiments you performed. Also talk about personal communication, if you had. 
Give the URLs of the online compiler/interpreters you used to run your programs (10 points)
</li></ul>

<p><b>Submission:</b></p>
<p> A single <b><code>zip</code></b> or <b><code>rar</code></b> file should be submitted containing the following files with given names:
</p><ol>
<li> A single file for <b> report</b>: <tt>lastname_name_report.pdf</tt>
</li><li> A folder called, <b>Codes</b>. The contents of the folder will be as follows:
<ol>
<li> A  single file for <b> C </b> code: <tt>lastname_name.c</tt>
</li><li> A  single file for <b> Go </b> code: <tt>lastname_name.go</tt>
</li><li> A  single file for <b> Javascript </b> code: <tt>lastname_name.html</tt>
</li><li> A  single file for <b> PHP </b>  code:<tt>lastname_name.php</tt>
</li><li> A  single file for <b> Python </b>  code: <tt>lastname_name.py</tt>
</li><li> A  single file for <b> Rust </b> code: <tt>lastname_name.rs</tt>
</li></ol>
</li></ol>

<p>Please upload the  <b><code>zip</code></b> or <b><code>rar</code></b> file you created to Moodle before the due date. 

</p><p><b>Important Notes:   </b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<p></p><li>Late submissions will be accepted, with 10 points (out of 100) deduction for each extra day.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li>You may use the tutorials available on the Internet as a reference, 
but do not derive your example from the contents of the tutorials. 
If you do so, your programs may be similar to others in the class,
that causes a disciplinary investigation.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li> Collaboration on the homework is not allowed.</li><p></p>
</ul>

<b>Grading Policy:</b>
<ol type="a">
<li>Discussion of design issues (50%)
</li><li>Evaluation of languages (10%)
</li><li>Learning strategy (10%)
</li><li>Code samples (30%)
</li></ol>
